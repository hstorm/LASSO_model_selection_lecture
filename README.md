## Learning aims

### Section 1: Lasso and friends
- Understand intuition of Regularized estimators (LASSO, ridge regression, etc) 
- Understand how LASSO can be used for model selection 

### Section 2: Approaches for model selection using LASSO  
- Understand difference between model selection for prediction and causal analysis
- Understand connection to econometrics model selection 
- Understand “Post-Lasso” model selection and its limitations
- Understand better approach for model selection using Lasso when doing causal analysis
